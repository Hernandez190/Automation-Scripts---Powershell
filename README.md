# Automation Scripts

I am trying to improve my scripting and programming skills.

Will go ahead and create sys admin type powershell scripts to automate workflows and they would be useful to someone who manages endpoints. 

Will be adding more as time goes on. 

These will be more useful when in a windows domain environment that already has global GPOs for firewall settings.
